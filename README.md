## Hello World
//Youâ€™ve created at least one new entrypoint (main_prod.dart, main_stag.dart).

//Your IDE run configuration / launch.json or flutter run -t command points to  those files instead of lib/main.dart.

flutter run -t lib/main_stag.dart --flavor staging
flutter run -t lib/main_prod.dart --flavor prod
